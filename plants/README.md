# Plant Directory Project

This webapp is a simple Express app, with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The baseline functionalities should include:

- Load all plants and display accordingly
- Implementation of search (by plant name) functionality


## Installation

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sunderland-Software-City/work-experience-projects.git
```

Change to the right project directory

```bash
cd work-experience-projects/plants
```

Install all the dependancies

```bash
npm install
```

Start your local Express server: 

```bash
node index.mjs
```

And you're all setup! The files are filled with comments such as `TODO:` as hints. 

## Prerequisites

1. Have Node installed. Run `node -v` in your terminal to check if Node is installed in your system.
2. Have `git` installed. Run `git -v` in your terminal to check if `git` is installed in your system.


## Extension ideas:
